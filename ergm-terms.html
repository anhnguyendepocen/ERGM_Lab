<p>
<code>ergm</code> functions such as <code>ergm</code> and <code>simulate</code> (for ERGMs) may operate in two modes: binary and weighted/valued, with the latter activated by passing a non-NULL value as the <code>response</code> argument, giving the edge attribute name to be modeled/simulated.
</p>
<p>
Binary ERGM statistics cannot be used in valued mode and vice versa. However, a substantial number of binary ERGM statistics — particularly the ones with dyadic indepenence — have simple generalizations to valued ERGMs, and have been adapted in <code>ergm</code>. They have the same form as their binary ERGM counterparts, with an additional argument: <code>form</code>, which, at this time, has two possible values: <code>“sum”</code> (the default) and <code>“nonzero”</code>. The former creates a statistic of the form <i>∑<em>{i,j} x</em>{i,j} y_{i,j}</i>, where <i>y_{i,j}</i> is the value of dyad <i>(i,j)</i> and <i>x_{i,j}</i> is the term’s covariate associated with it. The latter computes the binary version, with the edge considered to be present if its value is not 0.
</p>
<p>
Valued version of some binary ERGM terms have an argument <code>threshold</code>, which sets the value above which a dyad is conidered to have a tie. (Value less than or equal to <code>threshold</code> is considered a nontie.)
</p>
<h3>
Covariate transformations
</h3>
<p>
Some terms taking nodal or dyadic covariates take optional <code>transform</code> and <code>transformname</code> arguments. <code>transform</code> should be a function with one argument, taking a data structure of the same mode as the covariate and returning a similarly structured data structure, transforming the covariate as needed.
</p>
<p>
For example, <code>nodecov(“a”, transform=function(x) x^2)</code> will add a nodal covariate having the square of the value of the nodal attribute <code>“a”</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>transformname</code>, if given, will be added to the term’s name to help identify it.
</p>
<h3>
Terms to represent network statistics included in the <code>ergm</code> package
</h3>
<p>
A cross-referenced html version of the term documentation is is available via <code>vignette(‘ergm-term-crossRef’)</code> and terms can also be searched via <code>search.ergmTerms</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>absdiff(attrname, pow=1)</code> (binary) (dyad-independent) (frequently-used) (directed) (undirected) (quantitative nodal attribute), <code>absdiff(attrname, pow=1, form =“sum”)</code> (valued) (dyad-independent) (directed) (undirected) (quantitative nodal attribute)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Absolute difference:</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a quantitative attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. This term adds one network statistic to the model equaling the sum of <code>abs(attrname[i]-attrname[j])^pow</code> for all edges (i,j) in the network.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>absdiffcat(attrname, base=NULL)</code> (binary) (dyad-independent) (directed) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute), <code>absdiffcat(attrname, base=NULL, form=“sum”)</code> (valued) (dyad-independent) (directed) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Categorical absolute difference:</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a quantitative attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. This term adds one statistic for every possible nonzero distinct value of <code>abs(attrname[i]-attrname[j])</code> in the network; the value of each such statistic is the number of edges in the network with the corresponding absolute difference. The optional <code>base</code> argument is a vector indicating which nonzero differences, in order from smallest to largest, should be omitted from the model (i.e., treated like the zero-difference category). The <code>base</code> argument, if used, should contain indices, not differences themselves. For instance, if the possible values of <code>abs(attrname[i]-attrname[j])</code> are 0, 0.5, 3, 3.5, and 10, then to omit 0.5 and 10 one should set <code>base=c(1, 4)</code>. Note that this term should generally be used only when the quantitative attribute has a limited number of possible values; an example is the <code>“Grade”</code> attribute of the <code>faux.mesa.high</code> or <code>faux.magnolia.high</code> datasets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>altkstar(lambda, fixed=FALSE)</code> (binary) (undirected) (curved) (categorical nodal attribute)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Alternating k-star:</em> This term adds one network statistic to the model equal to a weighted alternating sequence of k-star statistics with weight parameter <code>lambda</code>. This is the version given in Snijders et al. (2006). The <code>gwdegree</code> and <code>altkstar</code> produce mathematically equivalent models, as long as they are used together with the <code>edges</code> (or <code>kstar(1)</code>) term, yet the interpretation of the <code>gwdegree</code> parameters is slightly more straightforward than the interpretation of the <code>altkstar</code> parameters. For this reason, we recommend the use of the <code>gwdegree</code> instead of <code>altkstar</code>. See Section 3 and especially equation (13) of Hunter (2007) for details. The optional argument <code>fixed</code> indicates whether the scale parameter <code>lambda</code> is to be fit as a curved exponential family model (see Hunter and Handcock, 2006). The default is <code>FALSE</code>, which means the scale parameter is not fixed and thus the model is a CEF model. This term can only be used with undirected networks.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>asymmetric(attrname=NULL, diff=FALSE, keep=NULL)</code> (binary) (directed) (dyad-independent) (triad-related)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Asymmetric dyads:</em> This term adds one network statistic to the model equal to the number of pairs of actors for which exactly one of <i>(i,j)</i> or <i>(j,i)</i> exists. This term can only be used with directed networks. If the optional <code>attrname</code> argument is used, only asymmetric pairs that match on the named vertex attribute are counted. The optional modifiers <code>diff</code> and <code>keep</code> are used in the same way as for the <code>nodematch</code> term; refer to this term for details and an example.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>atleast(threshold=0)</code> (valued) (directed) (undirected)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Number of ties with values greater than or equal to a threshold</em> Adds one statistic equaling to the number of ties whose values equal or exceed <code>threshold</code>.

<code>b1concurrent(by=NULL)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Concurrent node count for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network:</em> This term adds one network statistic to the model, equal to the number of nodes in the first mode of the network with degree 2 or higher. The first mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the “actor” mode. The optional argument <code>by</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list; it functions just like the <code>by</code> argument of the <code>b1degree</code> term. Without the optional argument, this statistic is equivalent to <code>b1mindegree(2)</code>. This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>b1degrange(from, to=+Inf, by=NULL, homophily=FALSE)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Degree range for the first mode in a bipartite (a.k.a. two-mode) network:</em> The <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> arguments are vectors of distinct integers (or <code>+Inf</code>, for <code>to</code> (its default)). If one of the vectors has length 1, it is recycled to the length of the other. Otherwise, they must have the same length. This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element of <code>from</code> (or <code>to</code>); the <i>i</i>th such statistic equals the number of nodes of the first mode (“actors”) in the network of degree greater than or equal to <code>from[i]</code> but strictly less than <code>to[i]</code>, i.e. with edge count in semiopen interval <code>[from,to)</code>. The optional argument <code>by</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. If this is specified and <code>homophily</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then degrees are calculated using the subnetwork consisting of only edges whose endpoints have the same value of the <code>by</code> attribute. If <code>by</code> is specified and <code>homophily</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (the default), then separate degree range statistics are calculated for nodes having each separate value of the attribute.
</p>
<p>
This term can only be used with bipartite networks; for directed networks see <code>idegrange</code> and <code>odegrange</code>. For undirected networks, see <code>degrange</code>, and see <code>b2degrange</code> for degrees of the second mode (“events”).

<code>b1degree(d, by=NULL)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute) (frequently-used)

<dd>
<p>
<em>Degree for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network:</em> The <code>d</code> argument is a vector of distinct integers. This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element in <code>d</code>; the <i>i</i>th such statistic equals the number of nodes of degree <code>d[i]</code> in the first mode of a bipartite network, i.e. with exactly <code>d[i]</code> edges. The first mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the “actor” mode. The optional argument <code>by</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. If this is specified then each node’s degree is tabulated only with other nodes having the same value of the <code>by</code> attribute. This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.

<code>b1factor(attrname, base=1)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (dyad-independent) (frequently-used) (categorical nodal attribute)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Factor attribute effect for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network :</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a categorical attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. This term adds multiple network statistics to the model, one for each of (a subset of) the unique values of the <code>attrname</code> attribute. Each of these statistics gives the number of times a node with that attribute in the first mode of the network appears in an edge. The first mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the “actor” mode. To include all attribute values is usually not a good idea, because the sum of all such statistics equals the number of edges and hence a linear dependency would arise in any model also including <code>edges</code>. Thus, the <code>base</code> argument tells which value(s) (numbered in order according to the <code>sort</code> function) should be omitted. The default value, <code>base=1</code>, means that the smallest (i.e., first in sorted order) attribute value is omitted. For example, if the “fruit” factor has levels “orange”, “apple”, “banana”, and “pear”, then to add just two terms, one for “apple” and one for “pear”, then set “banana” and “orange” to the base (remember to sort the values first) by using <code>nodefactor(“fruit”, base=2:3)</code>. This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.

<code>b1mindegree(d)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected)

<em>Minimum degree for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network:</em> The <code>d</code> argument is a vector of distinct integers. This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element in <code>d</code>; the <i>i</i>th such statistic equals the number of nodes in the first mode of a bipartite network with at least degree <code>d[i]</code>. The first mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the “actor” mode. This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.
</p>

<dt>
<code>b1nodematch(attrname, diff=FALSE, keep=NULL, by=NULL, alpha=1, beta=1, byb2attr=NULL)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (dyadic-independent) (categorical nodal attribute) (frequently-used)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em>Nodal attribute-based homophily effect for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network:</em> This term is introduced in Bomiriya et al (2014). The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a categorical attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. Out of the two arguments (discount parameters) <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>, both which takes values from [0,1], only one should be set at a time. If none is set to a value other than 1, this term will simply be a homophily based two-star statistic. This term adds one statistic to the model unless <code>diff</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, in which case the term adds multiple network statistics to the model, one for each of (a subset of) the unique values of the <code>attrname</code> attribute. To include only the attribute values you wish, use the <code>keep</code> argument. If an <code>alpha</code> discount parameter is used, each of these statistics gives the sum of the number of common second-mode nodes raised to the power <code>alpha</code> for each pair of first-mode nodes with that attribute. If a <code>beta</code> discount parameter is used, each of these statistics gives half the sum of the number of two-paths with two first-mode nodes with that attribute as the two ends of the two path raised to the power <code>beta</code> for each edge in the network. The <code>byb2attr</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a second mode categorical attribute in the network’s attribute list. Setting this argument will separate the orginal statistics based on the values of the set second mode attribute— i.e. for example, if <code>diff</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, then the sum of all the statistics for each level of this second-mode attribute will be equal to the original <code>b1nodematch</code> statistic where <code>byb2attr</code> set to <code>NULL</code>. This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.

<code>b1star(k, attrname=NULL)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute)

<p>
<em>k-Stars for the first mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network: </em> The <code>k</code> argument is a vector of distinct integers. This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element in <code>k</code>. The <i>i</i>th such statistic counts the number of distinct <code>k[i]</code>-stars whose center node is in the first mode of the network. The first mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the “actor” mode. A <i>k</i>-star is defined to be a center node <i>N</i> and a set of <i>k</i> different nodes <i>{O_1, …, O_k}</i> such that the ties <i>{N, O_i}</i> exist for <i>i=1, …, k</i>. The optional argument <code>attrname</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. If this is specified then the count is over the number of <i>k</i>-stars (with center node in the first mode) where all nodes have the same value of the attribute. This term can only be used for undirected bipartite networks. Note that <code>b1star(1)</code> is equal to <code>b2star(1)</code> and to <code>edges</code>.

<code>b1starmix(k, attrname, base=NULL, diff=TRUE)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
<em> Mixing matrix for k-stars centered on the first mode of a bipartite network:</em> Only a single value of <i>k</i> is allowed. This term counts all k-stars in which the b2 nodes (called events in some contexts) are homophilous in the sense that they all share the same value of <code>attrname</code>. However, the b1 node (in some contexts, the actor) at the center of the k-star does NOT have to have the same value as the b2 nodes; indeed, the values taken by the b1 nodes may be completely distinct from those of the b2 nodes, which allows for the use of this term in cases where there are two separate nodal attributes, one for the b1 nodes and another for the b2 nodes (in this case, however, these two attributes should be combined to form a single nodal attribute called <code>attrname</code>. A different statistic is created for each value of <code>attrname</code> seen in a b1 node, even if no k-stars are observed with this value. Whether a different statistic is created for each value seen in a b2 node depends on the value of the <code>diff</code> argument: When <code>diff=TRUE</code>, the default, a different statistic is created for each value and thus the behavior of this term is reminiscent of the <code>nodemix</code> term, from which it takes its name; when <code>diff=FALSE</code>, all homophilous k-stars are counted together, though these k-stars are still categorized according to the value of the central b1 node. The <code>base</code> term may be used to control which of the possible terms are left out of the model: By default, all terms are included, but if <code>base</code> is set to a vector of indices then the corresponding terms (in the order they would be created when <code>base=NULL</code>) are left out.

<code>b1twostar(b1attrname, b2attrname, base=NULL)</code> (binary) (bipartite) (undirected) (categorical nodal attribute)

<p>
<em> Two-star census for central nodes centered on the first mode of a bipartite network:</em> This term takes two nodal attribute names, one for b1 nodes (actors in some contexts) and one for b2 nodes (events in some contexts). Only <code>b1attrname</code> is required; if <code>b2attrname</code> is not passed, it is assumed to be the same as <code>b1attrname</code>. Assuming that there are <i>n_1</i> values of <code>b1attrname</code> among the b1 nodes and <i>n_2</i> values of <code>b2attrname</code> among the b2 nodes, then the total number of distinct categories of two stars according to these two attributes is <i>n_1(n_2)(n_2+1)/2</i>. This model term creates a distinct statistic counting each of these categories. The <code>base</code> term may be used to leave some of these categories out; when passed as a vector of integer indices (in the order the statistics would be created when <code>base=NULL</code>), the corresponding terms will be left out.

<em>Nodal attribute-based homophily effect for the second mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network:</em> This term is introduced in Bomiriya et al (2014). The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a categorical attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. Out of the two arguments (discount parameters) <code>alpha</code> and <code>beta</code>, both which takes values from [0,1], only one should be set at a time. If none is set to a value other than 1, this term will simply be a homophily based two-star statistic. This term adds one statistic to the model unless <code>diff</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, in which case the term adds multiple network statistics to the model, one for each of (a subset of) the unique values of the <code>attrname</code> attribute. To include only the attribute values you wish, use the <code>keep</code> argument. If an <code>alpha</code> discount parameter is used, each of these statistics gives the sum of the number of common first-mode nodes raised to the power <code>alpha</code> for each pair of second-mode nodes with that attribute. If a <code>beta</code> discount parameter is used, each of these statistics gives half the sum of the number of two-paths with two second-mode nodes with that attribute as the two ends of the two path raised to the power <code>beta</code> for each edge in the network. The <code>byb1attr</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a first mode categorical attribute in the network’s attribute list. Setting this argument will separate the orginal statistics based on the values of the set first mode attribute— i.e. for example, if <code>diff</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, then the sum of all the statistics for each level of this first-mode attribute will be equal to the original <code>b2nodematch</code> statistic where <code>byb1attr</code> set to <code>NULL</code>. This term can only be used with undirected bipartite networks.

<em>k-Stars for the second mode in a bipartite (aka two-mode) network: </em> The <code>k</code> argument is a vector of distinct integers. This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element in <code>k</code>. The <i>i</i>th such statistic counts the number of distinct <code>k[i]</code>-stars whose center node is in the second mode of the network. The second mode of a bipartite network object is sometimes known as the “event” mode. A <i>k</i>-star is defined to be a center node <i>N</i> and a set of <i>k</i> different nodes <i>{O_1, …, O_k}</i> such that the ties <i>{N, O_i}</i> exist for <i>i=1, …, k</i>. The optional argument <code>attrname</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. If this is specified then the count is over the number of <i>k</i>-stars (with center node in the second mode) where all nodes have the same value of the attribute. This term can only be used for undirected bipartite networks. Note that <code>b2star(1)</code> is equal to <code>b1star(1)</code> and to <code>edges</code>.

<em>In-degree:</em> The <code>d</code> argument is a vector of distinct integers. This term adds one network statistic to the model for each element in <code>d</code>; the <i>i</i>th such statistic equals the number of nodes in the network of in-degree <code>d[i]</code>, i.e. the number of nodes with exactly <code>d[i]</code> in-edges. The optional term <code>by</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. If this is specified and <code>homophily</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then degrees are calculated using the subnetwork consisting of only edges whose endpoints have the same value of the <code>by</code> attribute. If <code>by</code> is specified and <code>homophily</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (the default), then separate degree statistics are calculated for nodes having each separate value of the attribute.

<em>Mutuality:</em> In binary ERGMs, equal to the number of pairs of actors <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> for which <i>(i,j)</i> and <i>(j,i)</i> both exist. For valued ERGMs, equal to <i>∑<em>{i&lt;j} m(y</em>{i,j},y_{j,i})</i>, where <i>m</i> is determined by <code>form</code> argument: <code>“min”</code> for <i>(y_{i,j},y_{j,i})</i>, <code>“nabsdiff”</code> for <i>-|y_{i,j},y_{j,i}|</i>, <code>“product”</code> for <i>y_{i,j}y_{j,i}</i>, and <code>“geometric”</code> for <i>√{y_{i,j}}√{y_{j,i}}</i>. See Krivitsky (2012) for a discussion of these statistics. <code>form=“threshold”</code> simply computes the binary <code>mutuality</code> after thresholding at <code>threshold</code>.
</p>
<p>
This term can only be used with directed networks. The binary version also has the following capabilities: if the optional <code>same</code> argument is passed the name of a vertex attribute, only mutual pairs that match on the attribute are counted; separate counts for each unique matching value can be obtained by using <code>diff=TRUE</code> with <code>same</code>; and if <code>by</code> is passed the name of a vertex attribute, then each node is counted separately for each mutual pair in which it occurs and the counts are tabulated by unique values of the attribute. This means that the sum of the mutual statistics when <code>by</code> is used will equal twice the standard mutual statistic. Only one of <code>same</code> or <code>by</code> may be used, and only the former is affected by <code>diff</code>; if both <code>same</code> and <code>by</code> are passed, <code>by</code> is ignored. Finally, if <code>keep</code> is passed a numerical vector, this vector of integers tells which statistics should be kept whenever the <code>mutual</code> term would ordinarily result in multiple statistics.

<em>Factor attribute effect:</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character vector giving one or more names of categorical attributes in the network’s vertex attribute list. This term adds multiple network statistics to the model, one for each of (a subset of) the unique values of the <code>attrname</code> attribute (or each combination of the attributes given). Each of these statistics gives the number of times a node with that attribute or those attributes appears in an edge in the network. In particular, for edges whose endpoints both have the same attribute values, this value is counted twice. To include all attribute values is usually not a good idea – though this may be accomplished if desired by setting <code>base=0</code> – because the sum of all such statistics equals twice the number of edges and hence a linear dependency would arise in any model also including <code>edges</code>. Thus, the <code>base</code> argument tells which value(s) (numbered in order according to the <code>sort</code> function) should be omitted. The default value, <code>base=1</code>, means that the smallest (i.e., first in sorted order) attribute value is omitted. For example, if the “fruit” factor has levels “orange”, “apple”, “banana”, and “pear”, then to add just two terms, one for “apple” and one for “pear”, then set “banana” and “orange” to the base (remember to sort the values first) by using <code>nodefactor(“fruit”, base=2:3)</code>.

<em>Uniform homophily and differential homophily:</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character vector giving one or more names of attributes in the network’s vertex attribute list.

<em>Nodal attribute mixing:</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character vector giving the names of categorical attributes in the network’s vertex attribute list.

The term for the first node is omitted by default because of linear dependence that arises if this term is used together with <code>edges</code>, but its coefficient can be computed as the negative of the sum of the coefficients of all the other actors. That is, the average coefficient is zero, following the Holland-Leinhardt parametrization of the <span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub>1</sub></span> model (Holland and Leinhardt, 1981). The <code>base</code> argument allows the user to determine which nodes’ statistics should be omitted. The <code>base</code> argument can also be a vector of negative indices, to specify which should be added instead of deleted, and <code>base=0</code> specifies that all statistics should be included. This term can only be used with directed networks. For undirected networks, see <code>sociality</code>.

<em>Sender effect:</em> This term adds one network statistic for each node equal to the number of out-ties for that node. This measures the activity of the node.

<em>Ties in simmelian triads:</em> This term adds one statistic to the model equal to the number of ties in the network that are associated with Simmelian triads, as defined by Krackhardt and Handcock (2007). Each Simmelian has six ties in it but, because Simmelians can overlap in terms of nodes (and associated ties), the total number of ties in these Simmelians is less than six times the number of Simmelians. Hence this is a measure of the clustering of Simmelians (given the number of Simmelians). This term can only be used with directed networks.

<em>Number of ties between actors with similar (but not necessarily identical) attribute values:</em> The <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of a quantitative attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. This term adds one statistic, having as its value the number of edges in the network for which the incident actors’ attribute values differ less than <code>cotoff</code>; that is, number of edges between <code>i</code> to <code>j</code> such that <code>abs(attrname[i]-attrname[j])&lt;cutoff</code>.

<em>Undirected degree:</em> This term adds one network statistic for each node equal to the number of ties of that node. The optional <code>attrname</code> argument is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list that takes categorical values. If provided, this term only counts ties between nodes with the same value of the attribute (an actor-specific version of the <code>nodematch</code> term). This term can only be used with undirected networks. For directed networks, see <code>sender</code> and <code>receiver</code>. By default, <code>base=1</code> means that the statistic for the first node will be omitted, but this argument may be changed to control which statistics are included just as for the <code>sender</code> and <code>receiver</code> terms.

<em> Three-trails:</em> a.k.a. <code>threepath</code>. For an undirected network, this term adds one statistic equal to the number of 3-trails, where a 3-trail is defined as a “trail” of length three that traverses three distinct edges. Note that a 3-trail need not include four distinct nodes; in particular, a triangle counts as three 3-trails. For a directed network, this term adds four statistics (or some subset of these four specified by the <code>keep</code> argument), one for each of the four distinct types of directed three-paths. If the nodes of the path are written from left to right such that the middle edge points to the right (R), then the four types are RRR, RRL, LRR, and LRL. That is, an RRR 3-trail is of the form <i>i–&gt;j–&gt;k–&gt;l</i>, and RRL 3-trail is of the form <i>i–&gt;j–&gt;k&lt;–l</i>, etc. Like in the undirected case, there is no requirement that the nodes be distinct in a directed 3-trail. However, the three edges must all be distinct. Thus, a mutual tie <i>i&lt;–&gt;j</i> does not count as a 3-trail of the form <i>i–&gt;j–&gt;i&lt;–j</i>; however, in the subnetwork <i>i&lt;–&gt;j–&gt;k</i>, there are two directed 3-trails, one LRR (<i>k&lt;–j–&gt;i–&gt;j</i>) and one RRR (<i>k&lt;–j–&gt;i–&gt;j</i>).

<em>Transitive triads:</em> This term adds one statistic to the model, equal to the number of triads in the network that are transitive. The transitive triads are those of type <code>120D</code>, <code>030T</code>, <code>120U</code>, or <code>300</code> in the categorization of Davis and Leinhardt (1972). For details on the 16 possible triad types, see <code>triad.classify</code> in the <code>sna</code> package. Note the distinction from the <code>ttriple</code> term. This term can only be used with directed networks.

<em>Transitive ties:</em> This term adds one statistic, equal to the number of ties <i>i–&gt;j</i> such that there exists a two-path from <i>i</i> to <i>j</i>. (Related to the <code>ttriple</code> term.) The binary version takes a nodal attribute <code>attrname</code>, and, if given, all three nodes involved (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, and the node on the two-path) must match on this attribute in order for <i>i–&gt;j</i> to be counted. The binary version of this term can only be used with directed networks. The valued version can be used with both directed and undirected.

<em>Transitive weights:</em> This statistic implements the transitive weights statistic defined by Krivitsky (2012), Equation 13. The currently implemented options for <code>twopath</code> is the minimum of the constituent dyads (<code>“min”</code>) or their geometric mean (<code>“geomean”</code>); for <code>combine</code>, the maximum of the 2-path strengths (<code>“max”</code>) or their sum (<code>“sum”</code>); and for <code>affect</code>, the minimum of the focus dyad and the combined strength of the two paths (<code>“min”</code>) or their geometric mean (<code>“geomean”</code>). For each of these options, the first (and the default) is more stable but also more conservative, while the second is more sensitive but more likely to induce a multimodal distribution of networks.

<em>Triad census:</em> For a directed network, this term adds one network statistic for each of an arbitrary subset of the 16 possible types of triads categorized by Davis and Leinhardt (1972) as <code>003, 012, 102, 021D, 021U, 021C, 111D, 111U, 030T, 030C, 201, 120D, 120U, 120C, 210,</code> and <code>300</code>. Note that at least one category should be dropped; otherwise a linear dependency will exist among the 16 statistics, since they must sum to the total number of three-node sets. By default, the category <code>003</code>, which is the category of completely empty three-node sets, is dropped. This is considered category zero, and the others are numbered 1 through 15 in the order given above. By specifying a numeric vector of integers from 0 to 15 as the <code>d</code> argument, the user may specify a set of terms to add other than the default value of <code>1:15</code>. Each statistic is the count of the corresponding triad type in the network. For details on the 16 types, see <code>?triad.classify</code> in the <code>{sna}</code> package, on which this code is based. For an undirected network, the triad census is over the four types defined by the number of ties (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3), and the default is to add <code>1:3</code>, which is to say that the 0 is dropped; however, this too may be controlled by changing the <code>d</code> argument to a numeric vector giving a subset of <i>{0, 1, 2, 3}</i>.

<em>Triangles:</em> This term adds one statistic to the model equal to the number of triangles in the network. For an undirected network, a triangle is defined to be any set <i>{(i,j), (j,k), (k,i)}</i> of three edges. For a directed network, a triangle is defined as any set of three edges <i>(i,j)</i> and <i>(j,k)</i> and either <i>(k,i)</i> or <i>(i,k)</i>. The former case is called a “transitive triple” and the latter is called a “cyclic triple”, so in the case of a directed network, <code>triangle</code> equals <code>ttriple</code> plus <code>ctriple</code> — thus at most two of these three terms can be in a model. The optional argument <code>attrname</code> restricts the count to those triples of nodes with equal values of the vertex attribute specified by <code>attrname</code>.

<em>Triangle percentage:</em> This term adds one statistic to the model equal to 100 times the ratio of the number of triangles in the network to the sum of the number of triangles and the number of 2-stars not in triangles (the latter is considered a potential but incomplete triangle). In case the denominator equals zero, the statistic is defined to be zero. For the definition of triangle, see <code>triangle</code>. The optional argument <code>attrname</code> restricts the counts (both numerator and denominator) to those triples of nodes with equal values of the vertex attribute specified by <code>attrname</code>. This is often called the mean correlation coefficient. This term can only be used with undirected networks; for directed networks, it is difficult to define the numerator and denominator in a consistent and meaningful way.

<em>Transitive triples:</em> This term adds one statistic to the model, equal to the number of transitive triples in the network, defined as a set of edges <i>{(i,j), (j,k), (i,k)}</i>. Note that <code>triangle</code> equals <code>ttriple+ctriple</code> for a directed network, so at most two of the three terms can be in a model. The optional argument <code>attrname</code> is a character string giving the name of an attribute in the network’s vertex attribute list. If this is specified then the count is over the number of transitive triples where all three nodes have the same value of the attribute. This term can only be used with directed networks.

<em>2-Paths:</em> This term adds one statistic to the model, equal to the number of 2-paths in the network. For a directed network this is defined as a pair of edges <i>(i,j), (j,k)</i>, where <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> must be distinct. That is, it is a directed path of length 2 from <i>i</i> to <i>k</i> via <i>j</i>. For directed networks a 2-path is also a mixed 2-star but the interpretation is usually different; see <code>m2star</code>. For undirected networks a twopath is defined as a pair of edges <i>{i,j}, {j,k}</i>. That is, it is an undirected path of length 2 from <i>i</i> to <i>k</i> via <i>j</i>, also known as a 2-star.
